    A primitive lock is in one of two states, 'locked' or 'unlocked'.

    It is created in the unlocked state. It has two basic methods,
    :meth:`~GreenLock.acquire` and :meth:`~GreenLock.release`.
    When the state is unlocked, :meth:`~GreenLock.acquire` changes the
    state to locked and returns immediately.

    When the state is locked, :meth:`~GreenLock.acquire` blocks the current
    greenlet until a call to :meth:`~GreenLock.release` changes it to unlocked,
    then the :meth:`~GreenLock.acquire` call resets it to locked and returns.
