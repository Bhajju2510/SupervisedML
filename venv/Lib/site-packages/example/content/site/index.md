Lux is easy to install once you have python installed in your system:
```
    $ pip install lux
```
The above command installs ``lux`` into your python ``site_packages`` directory
and the ``luxmake.py`` command you can use to create lux projects:
```
    $ luxmake.py startproject helloworld
    project "helloworld" created
```
Lux has been designed to work with [AngularJS][] frontend and to load javascript
modules asynchronously via [RequireJS][].
